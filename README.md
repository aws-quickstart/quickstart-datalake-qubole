## Qubole on AWS Data Lake


This Quick Start configures a production-ready Qubole Data Service (QDS) environment that is built on a data lake foundation in the AWS Cloud. You can use this Qubole environment to process and analyze your own datasets, and extend it for your specific use cases. The Quick Start also deploys an optional environment with prepopulated data, notebooks, and queries to analyze structured and semi-structured data, in order to gain key business insights into product sales performance.

QDS is a cloud-native, autonomous data platform for analyzing and processing big data. Qubole self-manages and constantly analyzes and learns about the platformâ€™s usage through a combination of heuristics and machine learning, and provides insights and recommendations to optimize reliability, performance, and costs. Qubole works in concert with AWS services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), and Amazon Redshift.

The deployment and configuration tasks are automated by AWS CloudFormation templates that you can customize during launch. The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying the AWS CloudFormation template into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying the AWS CloudFormation template into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
